# clean-code
Hello, this is a change on my new branch.

To run locally you can use the following commands:
- npm install - downloads all dependencies
- npm run run - runs Main.ts, useful as an integration testing harness.
- npm run build - runs the compile process.
- npm test - runs all of the unit tests.
- npm run coverage - runs all of the unit tests and produces a coverage report.
